### Project (fictional) situation:

Developer in the technology department of a large financial company.

This company uses an internal web application that manages employee records. The application is old and uses jQuery on the front-end, which results in considerable bugs and an increase in internal complaints.

My role was to upgrade the application using React, to convert one of the four jQuery plugins used by the application into a React library and publish this library on [GitHub](https://github.com/Merite15/P14-OC-Modal-Library) and [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-react-modal) and provide [performance comparisons](/lighthouse-repport).

### Specifications:

-   Convert the entire project to React.
    -   Build a new version of the "Create Employee" and "Employee List" pages with React.
    -   Add a state management system.
    -   Ensure that everything is consistent in terms of style. A more modern design is welcome.
-   Convert one of the current four jQuery plugins to a React library. Replace the remaining three jQuery plugins with React components in the application.
    -   Only convert the code that deals with the actual functionality (The code conversion should not be an exact translation).
    -   Publish the converted plugin as a React library on GitHub or npmjs.com.
-   Perform Lighthouse performance tests comparing the old and new applications.
